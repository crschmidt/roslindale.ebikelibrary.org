# Curious about e-bikes? Try one from the Roslindale E-bike Lending Library!

The E-bike Lending Library is a free, not-for-profit service working to expand access to e-bikes in the area. We have a small collection of e-bikes that we lend out to community members for up to a week, for free.

**The Roslindale E-Bike Lending Library is a joint project with the [Camberville
E-Bike Lending Library](https://camberville.ebikelibrary.org)**. Any bike from the Camberville E-Bike Library can be 
borrowed and returned at our location in Roslindale Village. [Sign up](https://forms.gle/WkBo3KS4jfbQtgAr7) to borrow an e-bike or
[contact us](mailto:roslindale@ebikelibrary.org) with any questions.

### How it works

* Contact us to let us know which e-bike(s) you'd like to try.
* We'll get in touch to schedule a time to borrow an e-bike.
* Visit the library in to pick up an e-bike. If you haven't
    ridden an e-bike before, expect this to take 15-30 minutes, or
    longer if you want to try more than one e-bike.
* Enjoy e-biking for up to a week, then bring the e-bike back to the
    library.
* You can borrow an e-bike more than once, or borrow multiple e-bikes.
